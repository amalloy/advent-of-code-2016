My solutions to http://adventofcode.com/2016

Solutions written by someone trying to get some "practical" experience writing Python, or at least as practical as
simple self-contained exercises get.

Brevity is not a goal; I'm aiming to practice good Python idioms, and model the problem space well. Modeling the
problem space well will hopefully correlate with small part2 commits for each day.
